# 3D-N2V
An example of a noise2void network that can be used for 3D data denoising

## Environment
Python 3.9 and TensorFlow 2.10.

## User guide
1. Train the n2v model with 'n2v_3D_train.py';
2. Use the trained model to denoise the data with 'n2v_3D_predict.py';

## Data
The training and test datasets used in the example code have been uploaded to Google Cloud Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D-aT75k4QvCHbBzTBY2c_hRE8TIJaS06?usp=sharing
