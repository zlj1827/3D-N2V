# 3D-N2V
An example of a noise2void network that can be used for 3D data denoising

## Environment
Python 3.9 and TensorFlow 2.10.

## User guide
1. Train the n2v model with 'n2v_3D_train.py';
2. Use the trained model to denoise the data with 'n2v_3D_predict.py';

This work is a 3D application of jug's original N2V. The link to the original N2V is: https://github.com/juglab/n2v
